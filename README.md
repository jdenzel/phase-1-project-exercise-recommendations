# Exercise Recommendations

## **Description**

Displays a list of exercises recommended for a specific muscle group. When page first loads, all exercises are shown on the webpage until user chooses a muscle group from the drop down meny. If the user chooses the muscle group shoulders it will only display exercises that work on the shoulder muscles. On the bottom of the information box there is a description on what equipment is used to perform the exercise.

The exercises shown are actually some of the ones that I do when I workout so I thought they'd be great to show.
